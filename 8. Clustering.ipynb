    "\n",
    "No one wrote down that Class A and B exist, but you can deduce from the data that they might.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-Means\n",
    "The most common clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign: Randomly draw cluster centres.\n",
    "- Figure out which points are closer to (correspond to) center 1 than center 2 and vice versa. Do this by drawing a line between the two cluster centers and then draw a orthogonal line equidistant to the two cluster centers that separates the plane into two spaces.\n",
    "[Assigning](images/8-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimise: \n",
    "- Change cluster center position to minimise the total kinetic distance // state of minimum energy for rubber bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. \n",

    "\n",
    "### K-means parameters: \n",
    "1. `n_clusters` number of clusters\n",
    "    - Most important. Can be challenging\n",
    "    - Default is 8\n",
    "2. `max_iter` \n",
    "    - Max number of iteration of the k-means algorithm for a single run.\n",
    "    - Default is 300. Quite reasonable, often terminates before reaching 300 iterations.\n",
    "3. `n_init`\n",
    "    - Number of different initialisations you use. -> Repeat alg so ensemble of clusterings gives you soething that makes sense even if some clusterings are wrong because of bad or challenging initialisations.\n",
    "    - Default: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "- Output for any fixed training set (with a fixed number of cluster centers) won't always be the same\n",
    "    - Because uses hill-climbing algorithm -> is highly dependent on initial conditions.\n",
