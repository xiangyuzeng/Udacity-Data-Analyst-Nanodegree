    "* -> Network cannot rely on any given activation to be present because it may get destroyed at any moment.\n",
    "* -> This forces network to learn redundant representations to ensure that at least some information remains. -> Seems inefficient but this makes things more robust and prevents overfitting. It also makes your network act as though it's taking a consensus over an ensemble of networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Op: If dropout doesn't work for you, you should probably be using a bigger network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating a Dropout-Trained Network\n",
    "When you evaluate the network that's been trained with dropout, you don't want randomness - you want something deterministic. You want the consensus. You get this by averaging activations. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you get this? \n",
    "* During training, don't only zero -> Scale remaining activations by factor of two. \n",
    "* When evaluating, remove dropout and scaling operations to get an average of the activations that is properly scaled."
